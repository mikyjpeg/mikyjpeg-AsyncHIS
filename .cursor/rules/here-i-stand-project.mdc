This is the context of the work we're doing: this is a discord bot (developed using discord.js) and a React website at the same time to play the game Here I Stand by GMT in asynchronous mode. The idea is to maintain a state within the data folder in form of json data that are updated. The website should showcase an updated version of the board based on the state.
Here I Stand (HIS) rules are loaded as a pdf in resources/HIS_RULES_2023-Final.pdf
HIS official site is https://www.gmtgames.com/p-917-here-i-stand-500th-anniversary-reprint-edition-2nd-printing.aspx 

We're maintaining bot commands in src/commands with managers for the various area in src/game.
In scripts/ there are script to manipulate the state, or import from files, as una tantum. Ideally should be deleted eventually.

The game cover both political and religious control. Religious control is managed in space with the boolean field "catholic". By default is true at the start of the game, but can change to false when the space is converted to Protestantism. The field is missing from spaces that are out of scope, as all the Ottoman home spaces.
