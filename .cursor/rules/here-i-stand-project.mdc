This is the context of the work we're doing: this is a discord bot (developed using discord.js) and a React website at the same time to play the game Here I Stand by GMT in asynchronous mode. The idea is to maintain a state within the data folder in form of json data that are updated. The website should showcase an updated version of the board based on the state.
Here I Stand (HIS) rules are loaded as a pdf in resources/HIS_RULES_2023-Final.pdf
HIS official site is https://www.gmtgames.com/p-917-here-i-stand-500th-anniversary-reprint-edition-2nd-printing.aspx 

We're maintaining bot commands in src/commands with managers for the various area in src/game.
In scripts/ there are script to manipulate the state, or import from files, as una tantum. Ideally should be deleted eventually. in data/ we keep json file representing the status of games and all its components, as well as base configuration.

The game cover both political and religious control. Religious control is managed in space with the boolean field "catholic". By default is true at the start of the game, but can change to false when the space is converted to Protestantism. The field is missing from spaces that are out of scope, as all the Ottoman home spaces.

Factions are defined in data/factions folders. Factions are also often referred to as Power. There are minor powers and major powers.
Each factions has leaders that are defined in data/leaders. Leaders can be added in spaces via formations.
Each faction has also rulers, that are defined in data/rulers. There's only a current ruler and we defined ruler succession for all major powers.
Spaces belongs to europ map and define where formations are and how can they move around.

Each bot command is recorded in an history using src/game/commandHistoryManager.js and must be undoable.
